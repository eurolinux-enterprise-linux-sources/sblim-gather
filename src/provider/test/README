Test Environment for SBLIM Metrics Instrumentation

The SBLIM project offers a Test Suite to perform tests against
the provider implementation and consistence tests against system
values.

Prerequisites are : 

- gather package properly installed
- wbemcli in version 1.4 installed
- testsuite package installed


make test
... to test the existence of a testsuite directory

make install 
... to install the input files into the corresponding testsuite
directories

make uninstall
... to delete the gather specific files out of the testsuite
directories

Make sure the CIMOM is running.
The Linux_MetricGatherer service will be started by the test script.

Run the test in the testsuite dir by executing . test-gather.sh

If the environment is not set up properly the script will exit with an
error message. Otherwise, the script will execute all the testcases and
store the results in the ./stat directory.

HINT: a 'grep "failed :" *' in the ./stat directory will list the number
and location of failed testcases. 

A word of CAUTION: this is a long-running test. Be patient.
